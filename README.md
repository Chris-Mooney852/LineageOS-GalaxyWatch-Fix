# Samsung Note 10+ Galaxy Watch Fix
A script to trick certain apps (Galaxy Wearable, Samsung Accessory Service etc) into thinking the phone is not samsung,
allowing the galaxy watch to be used on LineageOS

# Useage
If your using this script you should know how to enable dev tools, and have adb installed.
Both of which are required for these scripts to work

Using [sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd)
`./runfix.sh`

Using sed
`./runfix_sed.sh`

**Restart your phone**

# Disclaimer
This works on my phone, and has only been tested on a Note 10+ 4g.
I take no responsibily if this bricks your phone.
